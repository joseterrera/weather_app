This is a simple jquery mobile weather app. It is not mine. It is a project from treehouse, but I decided that for my own feeling of fulfilment, and so that other people can get a sense of my direction, I will upload it, with my own notes at the bottom. These notes will help me  precise my level of understanding and those areas that I especially struggle with. I don't expect anyone to scream "Eureka" from this notes....some things are likely to be misunderstandings...



I would like to revise this project in a few months. 
In this project, I found the second part more complicated as I still have not internalized fully ajax (or javascript for that matter). I can read it somewhat, but I think my weakest point is figuring out the first steps, and often I find myself not knowing how to go on....

This is a weather app where there is a menu on the left side with some cities with a current location. With an api from forecast.io we update the weather on each city this app has. 



What do we need?
3 functions: loadWeather, loadCity, loadDefaultCity.

1. loadWeather has two variables:
latlng: this variable will indicate the city where we are at.

forecastURL: the api key with a "+ latlng" at the end;


loadWeather will have the ajax request with a success method and an error method. 
success: we populate #current_temp and #current_summary with html method (i.e. json.currently.temperature), also for the icon is different, it has 2 parameters( i think the first one indicates what we need to change, and the second one how we intend to change it).

2. loadCity
We need to overwrite the click functionality, so when a user clicks on a city it will call a function loadCity
$("a.city").bind('click', function(){
	loadCity($(this).html);
})

We create the array cities with their latitudes and longitudes.

loadCity: The first thing is to change the location so that it updates to the name that was selected in the left panel. $("#location").html(city)
Next we need to load the weather for that particular city. For that we need to create an associative array(cities) with the coord for each city. (geocoder.us will give you a lat and long for that city).

loadWeather then will access the associative array.

We need to change the loadWeather function to take in the latitude and longitude.

We do that with the variable latlng.
